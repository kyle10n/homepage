      <h1>Professional</h1>
      <p>2023ish: Started taking computer science courses at The Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University. At Stockholm I took more math courses and built a degree.</p>
      <p>2022 - 2024: Worked at some other start ups, and realized I was born just early enough for the new tech revolution. Too late for napster/google/facebook but it seems if I learned more about computer science I could be right on time for this new wave.</p>
      <p>2017 - 2021: Finally worked at my first start up after years working during university at big companies. Natural Language Processing and AI but unfortunately no transformer models.</p>
      <p>2016: Grauduated from University of Toronto with a Honours Bachelor of Arts: Economics and Philosophy.</p>
